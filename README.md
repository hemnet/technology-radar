# Hemnet's Technology Radar

We document Hemnet’s technology landscape with a Technology Radar. It covers technologies that we currently use, what we have put on hold and things we evaluate/see potential in. It should be considered as documentation and not the definite answer to what technologies we can use.

## Assessment definitions

## <span style="color:green"> ✅ **ADOPT** </span>

- Technologies with broad adoption, in which Hemnet is willing to invest long-term.

## <span style="color:green">🧪 **TRIAL**</span>

 - Captures all current experiments in production.

## <span style="color:orange"> 🔬️ **ASSESS** </span>

- Active, non-production assessments of promising technologies and trends.

## <span style="color:red"> 🛑 **HOLD**</span>

 - Discouraged from broad adoption where Hemnet is not willing to invest further; no new applications may use this technology.

## How we maintain it

The Technology Radar is maintained by our *Architecture Council* - who faciliate and drive the technology selection discussions at Hemnet.

The Technology Radar is open for contribution by all teams at Hemnet and depends on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls, and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.
